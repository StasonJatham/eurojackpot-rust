# Eurojackpot - Rust

Inspired by my dear friend who motivated me to write this code with his iconic quote "You do know how randomness works, don't you?"

## Explaination

Every shit code needs to be explained. This was my first attempt at Rust. I wrote it with ChatGPT and the Rust documentation and myself. Personally i don't know why everyone can't just use python, but this is a lot faster than my previous project. It was also a huge headache.

## Shoutout

to Rust compiler who never stopped to remind me of ways to improve.
